## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK (API 24 or higher)
- Gradle 8.5.1+

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/splitwise-mobile.git
   cd splitwise-mobile
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to the cloned directory

3. **Sync Gradle**
   - Android Studio will automatically prompt to sync Gradle
   - Wait for dependencies to download

4. **Configure Backend URL**
   - Update the `BASE_URL` constant in your Java activity files to point to your backend server
   - The URL is currently hardcoded in multiple activity files and should be centralized

5. **Run the App**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio

## 📱 How to Use

1. **Registration**
   - Open the app and tap "Register"
   - Enter a unique username and password
   - Your password is securely hashed before storage

2. **Create or Join a Group**
   - After login, choose to create a new group or join an existing one
   - Creating a group generates a unique group code
   - Share the code with friends to let them join

3. **Add Expenses**
   - Tap the floating action button (+) on the group dashboard
   - Enter the amount, reason, and select who paid
   - Choose how to split the expense
   - Submit to record the transaction

4. **View Balances**
   - Navigate to the "Balances" tab to see who owes whom
   - Amounts are automatically calculated based on transactions

5. **Settle Up**
   - Go to the "Settle" tab
   - Select the person you want to settle with
   - Confirm the settlement to mark debts as paid

## 🔐 Security

- **Password Encryption**: All passwords are hashed using SHA-256 before transmission
- **Secure Communication**: API calls are made over HTTPS
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text

## 🌐 API Integration

The app communicates with a RESTful backend API for:
- User authentication and registration
- Group management (create, join, fetch)
- Transaction operations (add, delete, update)
- Balance calculations and settlements

### Backend Configuration
The backend URL is configured in individual activity files. For production use, it's recommended to:
- Centralize the URL in a Constants or Configuration file
- Use environment variables or BuildConfig for different environments
- Implement proper API authentication and security measures
